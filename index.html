<h2>About The Project</h2>

<p>
    This project is a website and mobile redesign for SPARK, which is a non-profit organization created to amplify the voices of women, people, and bring attention to reproductive justice.</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<p>
    SPARK was designed to inform and educate women and people in the LGBTQ+ community on their reproductive rights and the pressing issues they face. We have observed that users have a hard time understanding the key purpose of the organization due to overwhelming navigation and poor user interface elements causing users confusion when looking for key details about the organization.</p>

<h1>
    Research
</h1>

<br></br>

<p>
    Building this project was a team effort so I want to start off by acknowledging my teammates. Everyone took part in the research as well as the UI design. We all took equal parts in brainstoming the choice of website, creating interview questions, wireframing, and user interface design.
</p>

<p>
    It was a great experience collaborating on this re-design from start to finish and i’m eager to collaborate on more work in the future!
</p>

<h2 class="u-int">User Interviews</h2>

<p1>
    As a team, we conducted surveys and interviews relating to the user’s understanding of the website and the organization.</p1>

<h3>
    What did I find?
</h3>

<ul class="user-li">
    <li>
        Many users don’t know about their reproductive rights.
    </li>
    <li>
        Users aren’t clear about what their donations are going to.
    </li>
    <li>
        Users feel overwhelmed by the navigation bar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Users feel confused about the main purpose of the organization. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Users noticed some navigation items leading them to blank pages with no information to showcase.
    </li>
</ul>

    What the user is saying...

<p2>
    "A woman should not be told what to do with her body."

    After interviewing many different users we continued to ideate the data and separate information into different categories. </p3>

    User Persona

<br></br>

<p>
    Our storyboard indicates that the user has been struggling with conception and is looking for a supportive resource that will allow her to share her sentiments on the issues women face when trying to concieve. 
</p>

<p>
    She comes across SPARK and is interested in learning more. She is pleased to find out that SPARK is a non-profit organization based in her hometown of Atlanta and that the website showcases a clear understanding of how she is able to get involved.

<h2>
    Current SPARK Website
</h2>

<br></br>
<br></br>

<p>
    As shown above, the current website has a lot of elements clustered together.  The use of color scheme is stark against the grey background and the navigation expands into tertiary drop down menus, creating an overwhelming experience for users. 
    The website was also created through Wordpress, giving us insight on the tools that were used to create the pages.
</p>


<h2>
    Card Sorting & Sitemap
</h2>

<div class="row-2">

</div>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<p>
    As a team, we went through the process of elimination based off of problem areas the user was facing to create a more streamlined navigation system. We wanted to pay close attention to Information Architecture, keeping the most important navigation at the top of the page. We lessened the amount of items within the navigation bar and planned to highlight the most important details about the organization on the homepage.

<h1>
    Design Phase
</h1>


<h2>
    Low Fidelity Wireframes
</h2>

<p1>
    I started my design process with low fidelity, digital, wireframes. I always felt it was easiest to start with digital tools to build out the blueprint using Miro or Figma.
</p1>

<h3>
    What can users do in the app?
</h3>

<img class="lowfi-1" src="images/Screen-1.png">


<ul class="lowfi-li">
    <li>
        Users are able to filter their experience by location, budget, and desired activities.
    </li>

    <li>
        Users are able to browse a location on the homescreen.
    </li>

    <li>
        They can discover and follow other travelers.
    </li>

    <li>
        They can message and collaboratively build an itineraray with fellow travelers.
    </li>

</ul>

<p5>
    After testing users I found that some users preferred to have a search icon to look for a location rather than browse the home screen. Many users felt that filtering by location, budget, and desired activities was very ideal. 
</p5>

<h1>
    Final UI Design
</h1>

<h2 class="f-title">
    Look & Feel
</h2>


<p5 class="hifi-p">
    I wanted to keep the design very neutral and minimalistic using white as the base color, dark grey as my secondary color, and black for the accent. I felt these set of colors were professional and simplistic.
</p5>

<img class="hifi-splash" src="images/TravlBee-Splash.png">

<p5 class="hifi-p2">
    Elements That I changed were adding a search icon to the top right of the Discover screen and adding iconography to the user profile page to add more flare. 
</p5>

<h4>
    What have I learned from this project?
</h4>

<p6>
    I enjoyed the entirety of this project. This was my first UX/UI project I’ve ever done and I learned everything about the UX process from start to finish. I’ve been able to gain a deeper understanding about how important it is to empathize with the user’s pain points, how to observe the quality of a product from a user’s perspective, and how to ideate all of the most important data to turn it into a seamless design. 
</p6>

<p7>
    Being as though this was my first project, there were many aspects I would want to delve deeper in like testing more users to get a bigger picture on what users want in a collaborative travel app. Next time, I would definitely look forward in testing more users to gain a deeper insight.
</p7>
